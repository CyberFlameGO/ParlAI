# Core classes for Task-Oriented Dialog (TOD)

For understanding usage of these classes, start with `tod_agents.py` (for understanding how to setup agents such that they work with new datasets) and `parlai/scripts/tod_world_script.py` (for understanding how to run simulations with the TOD conversations format. 

As a convention, files that have elements that are expected to be referenced outside of this directory (and outisde of `parlai/projects/tod_simulator`) are prefixed wth `tod_`.
